📄 WEBSITE DESIGN DOCUMENTATION
Project: Building, Construction & Real Estate Website
Tech Stack: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (Vanilla)
Storage: localStorage only — no database or backend

==============================
1. OVERVIEW
==============================
This is a multi-page static website for a company specializing in building, construction, and real estate. It includes an Admin Panel that allows content updates using Web Storage (localStorage), so no backend or server/database is required.

Content is stored and read entirely within the browser and persists using the browser’s storage.

==============================
2. TECHNOLOGIES USED
==============================
Frontend Only:

HTML5

CSS3

JavaScript (Vanilla ES6+)

Web Storage (localStorage) for all dynamic content

No backend (no Node.js, PHP, MySQL, JSON files)

7. ADMIN PANEL FEATURES
==============================
Admin login (credentials stored in code or localStorage)

Rich Text Editor (e.g., TinyMCE or ContentEditable div)

All data saved and retrieved from localStorage

Live previews on update

Image upload via FileReader API (no server upload)

No need for file or database updates

==============================
8. SECURITY
==============================
Admin login with password (stored in JS — not secure, just for demo)

Basic form validation (empty fields, proper email)

Sanitize HTML inputs (use textContent, avoid innerHTML when possible)

localStorage key names use a fixed schema (e.g., "services", "projects")

Obfuscation (optional): Encode content using btoa() if needed

⚠️ Not for production or sensitive data. This approach is for static demos or internal use.

==============================
9. FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS
==============================
Export/import localStorage data as JSON (for backup)

Search/filter for properties and projects

Simple role-based access (hardcoded)

Drag-and-drop sorting

Convert to PWA (Progressive Web App)

Migrate to real CMS or backend later (optional)

==============================
10. DEPLOYMENT
==============================
Static Hosting Options:

Replit (great for HTML/CSS/JS projects)

GitHub Pages

Netlify

Notes:

No .env or API keys required

All logic is client-side

localStorage data persists per browser
